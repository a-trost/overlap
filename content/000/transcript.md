**Alex** *00:07*  Welcome to The Overlap! This is just a preview of a podcast that's going to be all about the intersection between Design and Front End Web Development. I'm Alex, I am a front end web developer in New Haven, Connecticut.

**Elle**  *00:19*  I'm Elle. I'm a designer based in Philadelphia. On the show, we are going to talk about everything related to design and development. Nothing is out of bounds.

**Alex**  *00:27*  Yeah, so if you're a developer and you want to learn more about the nuance between typography and color while also bulking up on your own development skills, this show is going to be great for you.

**Elle**  *00:38*  If you're a designer and you just, you want to learn some new techniques or you want to tighten up your coding skills, this show is for you.

**Alex**  *00:44*  If you're thinking about a career change to design or development, this show is going to be a great asset for you.

**Elle**  *00:50*  Do you have Internet access and headphones and at least part of a brain? This show's for you.

**Alex**  *00:56*  I mean at least half of a brain, right?

**Elle**  *00:59*  That's the minimum.

**Alex**  *01:00*  That's not the maximum. I want to make that clear.

**Elle**  *01:03*  Min.

**Alex**  *01:04*  Yeah, that's a min.

**Alex**  *01:06*  We teach each other what we know about our fields and we crack jokes when we mess it up.

**Elle**  *01:10*  We want to help you expand your skills so you can be a better designer and developer and maybe help you collaborate with the other people on your team.

**Alex**  *01:15*  Yeah, we want to do that in a fun and easy to listen to way. We're pretty much the sweatpants of design podcasts.

**Elle**  *01:23*  We're comfy. We're accessible. We're not invited to important events.

**Alex**  *01:27*  So look for us on our website https://www.overlappodcast.com and on Twitter @overlappod.
