Creative briefs, design briefs, brand briefs, project briefs...whatever you want to call it, the goal is always the same: Successful design + development projects.

On this episode, we talk about the creative brief, an essential document that can position you as an expert and help you get buy-in from your client at the beginning of a project.

Kicking off a new project? Try using a creative brief to guide your conversation and ask your client the right questions.

Creative briefs can be used for any collaborative creative work and are a great project management tool.
