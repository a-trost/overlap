Print's not dead! On this episode, we talk about why color looks different on screen and on paper, how best to handle a document for print, tips on handling fonts, and the difference between Adobe Illustrator and Indesign.

If you're a developer, being able to order print can help you deepen existing client partnerships and land new projects. If you're new to print design, we've got some helpful hints on how to navigate the jargon-filled world of print.
