Jason Lengstorf is an advocate, engineer, and sometimes designer. As "Human Duct Tape", Jason tells us about the little-bit-of-everything he does at Gatsby. On this episode, we talk to Jason about what's new with Gatsby (Themes! Preview beta!), building a positive open-source community, how to connect technology to build awesome stuff, and how important it is to fully disconnect from the day job to stay creative.
